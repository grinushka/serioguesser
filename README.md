# Serioguesser 

Go ahead and play the game if you love TV shows (well, who doesn't anyway?), that will show you how well you know the industry.
I tried to do a mix up of the most well-know TV shows for the last 20 years or so, but there still might be some you do not not, because of the prejudices view and a want to put my favourites in here.

The same game logic may be applied to any other things with the distinctive melody and sound (music, cartoons, famous people voices etc.)

Hope you enjoy it!

Note: the project have not been finished yet, so some bugs may arise. Sorry! :)
